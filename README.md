# Weather Impact Score Development 
A project developed in collaboration with the Aggie Data Science Club and Southwest Airlines. 
This repository includes our machine learning model used for computing weather impact scores and other weather-related metrics, samples of our processed datasets, model outputs, and an interactive map of airports that Southwest Airlines services, featuring airport selection and dynamic radius scaling based on weather parameters.
