1. Our full data was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Services Transtats website, and the Meteostat library in Python. 
2. We accessed the data in Transtats by filtering for specific conditions that were relevant to this project from the On-Time Performance dataset: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr&gnoyr_VQ=FGJ 
3. We pulled the Meteostat data and got snapshots of the weather conditions every 2 hours for each airport we investigated.
