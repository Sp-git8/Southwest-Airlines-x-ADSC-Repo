1. Our full data was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Services Transtats website, and the Meteostat library in Python. 
2. We accessed the data in Transtats by filtering for specific conditions that were relevant to this project from the airplane page. Based off of the dates and times that were associated with the flights from the Transstats, we pulled the Meteostat data for that day in Python.
