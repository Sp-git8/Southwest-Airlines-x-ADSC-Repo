- You can also reset the map view to its original viewpoint with the “Reset” button
- The “Select an Airport” dropdown menu zooms into the airport you select
- The “Weather Score Radius Parameter” dropdown menu allows you to select different weather parameters, changing their range of effect for each airport according to the weather parameter chosen
- The airports can be pressed (click on the radius/circle) to see the specific airport's name, code, and corresponding Weather Score
